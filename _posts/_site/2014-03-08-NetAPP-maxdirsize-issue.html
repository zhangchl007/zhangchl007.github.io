  <p>05:31:00 PM
DBA team got IBM Ops team’s on-call to check the oracle database on LMCAS050</p>

  <p>05:09:29 PM
DBA checked the oracle core services were not down but there’is error message[ORA-09925:Unable to create audit trail file shown when new session connects into database</p>

  <p>06:13:00 PM
DBA team found the OS issue that Oracle audit trace logs couldn’t be cretaed into the OS directory “/busdata/rfyt/lmc1/oracle/admin/adump” and when executing the command “ls -lrat |tail -20” to simply list the files under this directory of Oracle audit logs but no outputs are shown for long times.</p>

  <p>06:15:00 PM
DBA team assisted OS support team to help diagnose this issue from OS perspective.</p>

  <p>06:20:00 PM
OS team support checked the OS’s performance, confirmed there are no OS issue happened at the OS level</p>

  <p>07:20:00 PM
PCM team cooperate the relavent teams to diagnose this issue, tried to communicate the application supporting team to restart the FYT application.</p>

  <p>08:20:00 PM
As the oracle database is also being userd by the other applcation module.PCM held the conference to discuss to get the corresponding approval to restart the database.</p>

  <p>08:40:00 PM
After got the PCM’s verbal approval, DBA team restarted the database, but the ORA-09925 is still existing</p>

  <p>08:54:00 PM
DBA team tried to rename the previous folder “adump” to “adump.old”. and then re-create one new folder “adump” under the directory</p>

  <p>08:55:00 PM
After took this temporary solution, the issue was fixed temporary per got confirmed.</p>

   Rename the directory of oracle audit log                            DBA                       MAR-28             Done
   Refined the options of  maxdirsize in LMC  NAS                Storage                  MAR-31            Done</p>

  <p>Section 4 – Root Cause</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Why the end user can’t open FYT management module
Because FYT can’t create a new oracle session</li>
    <li>
      <p>Why FYT can’t create a new oracle session ?
Because oracle audit log couldn’t be created under the defined path: /oracle/app/oracle/admin/test/adump/</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Why oracle audit log couldn’t be created under the defined path?
 Oracle database had produced over 600 thousand small audit logs ,As the oracle audit function is enabled according to compliance with GSD331 security police’s requirement, So it’s normal situation that there’re very many oracle audit trace logs to be generated. Hence,
 the Directory entry file size on disk that a directory file takes up is over the maxdirsize  limit In NAS, the new audit log file can’t be created under the current directory</p>

      <p>Please refer to the following link: 3011562</p>

      <p>The actual value &gt;  The default value
The default value of maxdirsize to on NAS is 45875 <br />
